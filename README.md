## üöÄ Projects Highlights

### üìä [Time Series Forecasting with XGBoost](https://github.com/Emmanuel-Chukwuma/time_series_prediction_for_energy_usage)
- **Description**: This repository contains a comprehensive pipeline for time series forecasting hourly energy usage using the XGBoost machine learning model. The workflow covers data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation, making it suitable for predictive analytics.
- **Tech Stack**: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Numpy etc


### üåê [Campaign-Response-Prediction-and-Revenue-Increase]([link-to-repo-or-demo](https://github.com/Emmanuel-Chukwuma/Campaign-Response-Prediction-and-Revenue-Increase/tree/main))
- **Description**: In this project an online delivery service's customers are segmented and a model is built that correctly predicts users that will respond positively to their campaign messages, hence improving revenue. By the end of this project, a model capable of predicting customers who will accept iFood‚Äôs campaigns, with an accuracy rate of 87%, will be developed. However, it is noticed that iFood has a low acceptance rate from its customers, which is potentially impacting its revenue. Two solutions (improve customer engagement and include family-friendly deals) will be recommended to increase acceptance rate and revenue.

- **Tech Stack**: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, HTML, Numpy etc.]


### üìä [Customer Behavior Analysis](https://github.com/Emmanuel-Chukwuma/customer_behaviour_analysis)
- **Description**: This dataset will be explored to examine customer behavior for churn analysis. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of E-Commerce data will help us identify patterns and factors contributing to customer churn, which can help in developing strategies for customer retention and improving overall business performance.

- **Tech Stack**: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib

### [NFL Predictive Analytics Project](https://github.com/Emmanuel-Chukwuma/NFL_touchdown_prediction)
- **Description**: This project provides an in-depth analysis of NFL data, offering valuable insights into player performance, team statistics, and game outcomes. Using Python and popular data science libraries, this notebook aims to uncover patterns and trends within the NFL dataset.

-  **Tech Stack**: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Numpy, Seaborn, Scikit-learn
